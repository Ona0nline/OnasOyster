    <p class="more-on-gr">I initially discovered this masterpiece, in 2021,
       when I felt like I needed new music but didnt know what genre I was looking
      for. I ended up searching "alt rnb" on youtube and it was the first video that popped up.
      It heavily influenced what my taste is today.
      What I especially love about this video is the beautiful depiction of what love
      looks/feels like. The production quality is also incredible.
